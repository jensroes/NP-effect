# NP-effect
R and Stan code for a pooled reanalysis of phrasal planning scope data (Hardy et al., 2019; 2020; Martin et al., 2010; Roeser et al., 2019) using linear mixed effects models (LMM) and mixture models (Mixture of Gaussians; MoG). The LMM code is based on Sorensen et al. (2016). The MoG code is based on Vasishth et al. (2017a); see also Vasishth et al. (2017b).
